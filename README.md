Product Information:

"Backup" and "spritebud" are a setting and application backup/restore system written by Sprite Software and deployed on LG Android smartphones. "Backup" is the end user front end app, and "spritebud" is the service that preforms the backup and restore functions.


Details:

The "spritebud" daemon is started by the init scripts and runs as the root user. Listening on a unix socket, the daemon accepts instructions from the "Backup" app. Using a crafted backup, we can write to, change permission and change ownership of any file, being that "spritebud" is running under the root user.


The crafted backup contains restore data for our exploiting application, "com.cunninglogic.lgpwn". The data includes a 50mb dummy file (a) used to increase our exploit window, su binary (b), a script (c) to install su, and a text file (d) containing the path to our script. All files are owned by the application, and are world write/read/execute. All files are restored in alphabetical order. The entire backup, after compress, is approximately 2mb. The structure of this backup is as follows:


drwxrwxrwx u0_a114  u0_a114           2013-05-28 20:13 files


./files:
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114  52428800 2013-05-22 20:06 a
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114     91992 2013-05-22 20:07 b
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114       251 2013-05-22 20:12 c
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114        42 2013-05-22 20:07 d


Prior to restoration, our exploit app runs, watches the process and waits. During restoration, the spritebud daemon first creates the files directory, then sets it's permission and owner. Next it decompresses and restores the "a" file, our 50mb dummy files. During the restoration of "a", our exploit application has time to symlink "d", our text file containing the full path to our script (c), to /sys/kernel/uevent_helper. Upon restoration of file "d", our path is written to uevent_helper. When a hotplug even occurs (which occur every few seconds), the path contained in uevent_helper is execute by the kernel and our script (c) is executed and installs the su binary (b).
